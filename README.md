# W266 Final Project

* Example_Processed_Datasets: The files for our final model architecture had to be in a custom JSONLines Format. This contains some examples of the sentence alignment pairings that we had/used.
* Final_Model_Work_and_Architechture: This contains the code for running our modified script -- using the MBart model -- (run_translation.py could be called for training and testing) as well as the code we used to convert the csv data into JSONLines format.
* Initial_Model_Work: This contains all the code used in the BERT as an encoder and decoder structure.
* Generate_Translations_For_Viewing: This contains the code used to generate the Thai-English translation found in the appendix of the paper.
* Transfer Learning For Neural Machine Translation in the Thai-English Language Pairing: The Final Paper For w266
